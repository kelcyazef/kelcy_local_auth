# Changelog

## 1.0.0

*   Initial release of `local_auth_android_custom`.
*   Based on the original `local_auth` plugin version 1.1.7.
*   Modified to be Android-only: removed iOS native code, iOS platform declarations in `pubspec.yaml`, and iOS-specific Dart code.
*   Updated dependencies and linting to `flutter_lints`.
*   Removed non-essential files (AUTHORS, original CHANGELOG, LICENSE, README, Makefile, .iml, .patch).
*   Cleaned up iOS-specific code from the example app.
